Documents about Capstone Project "Air quality and Traffic volume in the Auckland City Centre  Jan 2018 to Feb 2023"
The Auckland city centre air quality monitoring sites have the highest concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. This study will explore the factors contributing to high pollutants levels in the city centre. The study will also examine the extent to which traffic volumes contribute to the levels of air pollutants.
Key questions:
• Why the city centre?
• What is the current air quality situation at the city centre (Trends)
• What is the relationship between traffic volume and key air pollutants?
• What is the pedestrian count dynamics in the city centre?
The project's findings will inform evidence-based decision-making processes for urban planners and help air quality management in the city centre.
